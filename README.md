## Usage
Apply Object.fx to the materials. (clone the fx file if you want to use the shader on 2 or more materials with different settings)

For in-depth customization, I've written comments explaining things in the Object.fx, you should be able to understand after reading it.

If you want to update your existing Object.fx to the newer version, read *Object.fx Update Guide.txt*

## Rules
✔️ **Modification is allowed (duh), you can customize the shader, or add new features to it all you want.**

✔️ **Including the shader with the models you distribute is allowed.**

❌ **Commercial use is not allowed**, please use other shaders that allow this.

❌ **Redistributing the shader (putting the intact shader as the main focus of the DL) is not allowed**, you can link this page or my dA post of the shader for the viewers to download it directly.

✔️ **However, it's fine for you to put your modification of the shader for DL.**

⚠️ The shader itself is not limited to any kind of contents. **The usage limit completely depends on the model you are going to apply the shader to.**

⚠️ **I am not responsible for any damages that are caused by the use of the shader**, please consider carefully when you use the shader.

🗿 **Beside that annoying begging for credit I made at the top, you should include the *MES40_credits.txt* in your DL if you use the shader, the shader is not the work of mine alone, so a full credits would be nice.** The txt will be updated alongside the shader.
